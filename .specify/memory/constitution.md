# Todo App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Simplicity & Beginner-Friendliness

**Principle**: All code MUST be written with beginners in mind. Complexity is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, and when complexity is required, it MUST be thoroughly justified and documented.

**Rules**:
- Use straightforward, self-documenting variable and function names
- Avoid advanced programming patterns (decorators, higher-order functions, complex closures) unless essential
- Prefer explicit code over clever/terse code
- Break down complex logic into smaller, easily understandable functions
- Each function should do one thing and do it well

**Rationale**: This project aims to be accessible to developers who are learning. Simple, clear code serves as better learning material and reduces the barrier to contribution. Code that beginners can read and understand is also easier to maintain and debug.

### II. Comprehensive Documentation via Comments

**Principle**: Code MUST include extensive inline comments explaining what each part does and why. Comments are not optional—they are a core requirement.

**Rules**:
- Every function MUST have a comment block explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value
- Complex logic MUST have inline comments explaining each step
- Variable declarations SHOULD include comments explaining their purpose when not immediately obvious
- Code blocks MUST have comments explaining the overall goal before implementation details
- Comments MUST be written in clear, beginner-friendly language

**Rationale**: Comprehensive comments serve as inline tutorials, helping beginners understand not just what the code does, but why it works that way. This transforms the codebase into a learning resource, not just a functional application.

### III. Modern JavaScript with Controlled Complexity

**Principle**: The project MUST use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features that improve readability and maintainability, but MUST avoid complex or advanced features that would confuse beginners.

**Approved Modern Features**:
- `let` and `const` (instead of `var`)
- Arrow functions for simple callbacks
- Template literals for string interpolation
- Destructuring for simple cases
- Array methods: `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`
- Async/await for asynchronous operations (with clear explanations)

**Restricted Features** (use only when essential and fully documented):
- Generators
- Proxies
- Complex destructuring patterns
- Advanced array methods (`.reduce()`, `.flatMap()`)
- Symbol primitives
- WeakMap/WeakSet

**Rationale**: Modern JavaScript offers cleaner syntax and better tools, but some features have steep learning curves. By selectively adopting modern features, we maintain code quality while keeping it accessible to those learning JavaScript.

### IV. Universal Accessibility

**Principle**: The application MUST be accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies. Accessibility is a first-class requirement, not an afterthought.

**Rules**:
- All interactive elements MUST be keyboard navigable
- All images and icons MUST have appropriate alt text or ARIA labels
- Color MUST NOT be the only means of conveying information
- Sufficient color contrast MUST be maintained (WCAG AA minimum)
- Semantic HTML MUST be used correctly (headings, lists, landmarks)
- Forms MUST have properly associated labels
- Dynamic content updates MUST be announced to screen readers (ARIA live regions)
- All features MUST be tested with keyboard-only navigation

**Rationale**: Accessibility ensures that everyone can use the application regardless of ability. It's a fundamental human right and also improves usability for all users. Building accessibility in from the start is easier and more effective than retrofitting it later.

### V. Minimal & Clean Design

**Principle**: The user interface and codebase architecture MUST prioritize simplicity and cleanliness. Visual clutter and architectural over-engineering are to be avoided.

**Rules**:
- UI elements MUST serve a clear purpose—remove anything extraneous
- Whitespace MUST be used generously to improve readability and reduce visual clutter
- Design patterns MUST be consistent throughout the application
- Code structure MUST be flat and simple—avoid deep nesting and complex hierarchies
- Dependencies MUST be kept to a minimum—prefer native solutions when practical
- CSS MUST be organized and minimal—no unused styles

**Rationale**: Minimal design reduces cognitive load for both users and developers. A clean interface is easier to navigate and use, while clean code is easier to understand and maintain. Simplicity leads to better performance, fewer bugs, and faster development cycles.

## Quality Standards

### Testing Requirements

- All user-facing features MUST have integration tests that validate the complete user journey
- Critical functions SHOULD have unit tests when they contain complex logic
- Accessibility features MUST be tested (automated and manual keyboard navigation)
- Tests MUST be written in beginner-friendly style with clear descriptions
- Test-first development is ENCOURAGED but not mandatory

### Documentation Requirements

- README MUST include:
  - Clear project description
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Usage examples with screenshots
  - Contribution guidelines
  - Accessibility statement
- Inline code comments (see Principle II)
- Each module/feature SHOULD have a brief README explaining its purpose

### Code Review Standards

- All code changes MUST be reviewed for:
  - Adherence to simplicity principle (Principle I)
  - Adequate commenting (Principle II)
  - Appropriate use of JavaScript features (Principle III)
  - Accessibility compliance (Principle IV)
  - Design cleanliness (Principle V)
- Reviewers MUST provide constructive, educational feedback
- Complex changes MUST be explained in the pull request description

## Development Workflow

### Branching Strategy

- `master` branch MUST always be in a deployable state
- Feature branches follow pattern: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Bug fix branches follow pattern: `fix/[bug-description]`
- All changes MUST go through pull requests—no direct commits to `master`

### Commit Standards

- Commits MUST have clear, descriptive messages
- Commit messages SHOULD explain "why" not just "what"
- Commits SHOULD be atomic (one logical change per commit)

### Pull Request Requirements

- Pull requests MUST include:
  - Description of changes
  - Screenshots for UI changes
  - Confirmation of accessibility testing
  - Notes on any complexity introduced (with justification)

## Governance

### Constitutional Authority

This constitution supersedes all other development practices, guidelines, and preferences. When in doubt, consult this document and prioritize its principles.

### Amendment Process

**Process**:
1. Proposed amendments MUST be documented in a pull request
2. Amendments MUST include clear rationale for the change
3. Team discussion and consensus required before adoption
4. Approved amendments update this document with version increment
5. Dependent templates and documentation MUST be updated to reflect changes

**Version Increment Rules**:
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Backward-incompatible changes—removing or fundamentally redefining principles
- **MINOR** (x.Y.0): Adding new principles or expanding existing guidance significantly
- **PATCH** (x.y.Z): Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic refinements

### Compliance Review

- All pull requests MUST verify constitutional compliance
- Violations MAY be accepted with explicit, documented justification in "Complexity Tracking" or equivalent section
- Repeated violations without justification will be rejected
- Team members are ENCOURAGED to call out constitutional concerns respectfully

### Complexity Justification

When deviation from principles is necessary (especially Principles I, III, V):
1. Document the specific principle being violated
2. Explain why the complexity or deviation is necessary
3. Describe what simpler alternatives were considered and why they were rejected
4. Include this justification in pull request and/or inline code comments

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-11 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-11
