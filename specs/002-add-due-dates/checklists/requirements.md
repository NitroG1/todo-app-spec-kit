# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Due Dates to Todos

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on user capabilities (date picker, visual indicators, sorting, filtering) without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or APIs.

✅ **Focused on user value**: All user stories explain the value to users (e.g., "helps users remember when tasks need to be completed and prioritize their work").

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: Language is accessible and focuses on what users can do rather than how the system works internally.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements (with Functional Requirements and Key Entities), and Success Criteria are all present and complete.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: All requirements are specified with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.

✅ **Requirements are testable**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-015) describes a specific, verifiable capability.

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 10 seconds", "100% of the time", "fully keyboard accessible").

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: No mention of implementation technologies - focused on user-facing outcomes.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story has 4-6 Given-When-Then scenarios covering the main flows.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: Six edge cases documented covering date boundaries, system date changes, data persistence, locale handling, and completed todo handling.

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: The feature is limited to due dates (date-only, no times), with clear boundaries around what is and isn't included.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: Assumptions section documents date format, locale handling, optional nature of due dates, and interaction with existing filters.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to specific acceptance scenarios in the user stories.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: Four prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover setting dates, displaying dates, sorting, and filtering in logical dependency order.

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: Eight success criteria (SC-001 through SC-008) provide comprehensive coverage of performance, usability, accessibility, and data persistence.

✅ **No implementation details leak**: The spec maintains focus on user needs and outcomes throughout.

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.

**Key Strengths**:
- Four well-prioritized user stories that can be implemented incrementally
- Comprehensive accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Clear handling of optional due dates and integration with existing features
- Detailed edge cases covering real-world scenarios

**No action items required** - specification meets all quality standards.
