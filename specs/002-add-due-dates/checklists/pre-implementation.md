# Pre-Implementation Review Checklist: Add Due Dates to Todos

**Purpose**: Validate requirement completeness, clarity, and consistency before coding begins - focusing on Accessibility, Data Model, and Visual/UX requirements quality
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Focus Areas**: Accessibility Requirements, Data Model & Storage, Visual/UX Precision
**Depth**: Standard Review (30-50 items)

**Note**: This checklist tests the REQUIREMENTS themselves for quality, not the implementation. Each item validates whether requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable.

- [ ] CHK022 - Is the date comparison logic requirement clearly specified (comparing ISO strings lexicographically vs Date object conversion)? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK023 - Are timezone handling requirements documented (store as date-only, interpret in user's local timezone)? [Assumption validation, Spec Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK024 - Are requirements defined for maintaining data consistency when system date changes while app is open? [Edge Case, Spec Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK025 - Is backward compatibility explicitly required (old version can still read new data structure)? [Gap]

## Visual/UX Requirements Precision

- [ ] CHK026 - Is the date picker UI component type requirement clearly specified (native HTML vs custom, with accessibility implications)? [Clarity, Spec Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK027 - Is the date display format requirement specified with locale considerations or explicit format (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY)? [Clarity, Spec Assumptions]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add findings or clarifications inline below each item
- Items marked `[Gap]` indicate potentially missing requirements
- Items marked `[Ambiguity]` indicate unclear requirements needing clarification
- Items with spec references `[Spec §X]` point to existing requirements to verify
- Focus on whether requirements are WRITTEN clearly, not whether code will work
