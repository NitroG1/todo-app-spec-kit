## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Set Due Date on Todo (Priority: P1)

Users can add an optional due date when creating a new todo or edit an existing todo to add/change its due date. This helps users remember when tasks need to be completed and prioritize their work.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables all other due date features. Without the ability to set due dates, the feature cannot provide any value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a todo with a due date, editing a todo to add a due date, and verifying the date is stored and displayed correctly. Delivers immediate value by letting users track when tasks are due.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am creating a new todo, **When** I enter a task description and select a due date from the date picker, **Then** the todo is created with the due date stored and displayed
2. **Given** I have an existing todo without a due date, **When** I click the edit icon next to the todo and add a due date, **Then** the due date is saved and displayed with the todo
3. **Given** I have a todo with a due date, **When** I click the edit icon and change the due date, **Then** the new due date replaces the old one and is displayed
4. **Given** I have a todo with a due date, **When** I click the edit icon and clear the due date, **Then** the todo no longer has a due date displayed
5. **Given** I am creating or editing a todo, **When** I do not select a due date, **Then** the todo is saved without a due date (due dates are optional)

### User Story 2 - Display Due Dates with Todos (Priority: P2)

Users can see due dates displayed clearly with each todo in the list, with visual indicators for overdue, due today, and upcoming tasks. This provides at-a-glance awareness of task urgency.

**Why this priority**: Depends on P1 (setting due dates) but is critical for making due dates useful. Without clear display, users cannot benefit from having set due dates.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating todos with various due dates (past, today, future) and verifying that each displays its due date with appropriate visual styling and indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have todos with due dates, **When** I view my todo list, **Then** each todo displays its due date in a clear, readable format
2. **Given** I have a todo that is overdue (due date in the past), **When** I view my todo list, **Then** the todo is visually marked as overdue with colored styling and a warning icon
3. **Given** I have a todo due today, **When** I view my todo list, **Then** the todo is visually highlighted to indicate it is due today with colored styling and a calendar/today icon
4. **Given** I have a todo with a future due date, **When** I view my todo list, **Then** the due date is displayed with neutral styling
5. **Given** I have completed a todo with a due date, **When** I view my todo list, **Then** the due date is still visible but styled to indicate the task is complete

### User Story 3 - Sort Todos by Due Date (Priority: P3)

Users can sort their todo list by due date in ascending or descending order, allowing them to view tasks in order of urgency or to see the furthest-out tasks first.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability but requires P1 and is valuable alongside P2. Sorting helps users organize their view of tasks by urgency.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating multiple todos with different due dates and verifying that the sort controls arrange them correctly by due date, with appropriate handling of todos without due dates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have multiple todos with different due dates, **When** I sort by due date (ascending), **Then** todos are displayed with earliest due dates first, followed by later dates, with undated todos at the end
2. **Given** I have multiple todos with different due dates, **When** I sort by due date (descending), **Then** todos are displayed with latest due dates first, followed by earlier dates, with undated todos at the end
3. **Given** I have sorted my todos by due date, **When** I add a new todo with a due date, **Then** the todo is inserted in the correct position according to the current sort order
4. **Given** I have sorted my todos by due date, **When** I edit a todo's due date, **Then** the todo moves to the correct position according to the current sort order

---

### User Story 4 - Filter Todos by Due Date (Priority: P4)

Users can filter their todo list to show only todos matching specific due date criteria (e.g., overdue, due today, due this week, no due date). This helps users focus on relevant tasks.

**Why this priority**: Most advanced feature that builds on all others. Provides powerful organization but is not essential for basic due date functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating todos across various due date ranges and verifying that each filter option shows only the appropriate todos.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have todos with various due dates, **When** I apply the "Overdue" filter, **Then** only todos with due dates in the past are displayed
2. **Given** I have todos with various due dates, **When** I apply the "Due Today" filter, **Then** only todos with today's date are displayed
3. **Given** I have todos with various due dates, **When** I apply the "Due This Week" filter, **Then** only todos with due dates within the next 7 days are displayed
4. **Given** I have todos with various due dates, **When** I apply the "No Due Date" filter, **Then** only todos without due dates are displayed
5. **Given** I have applied a due date filter, **When** I clear the filter, **Then** all todos are displayed again
6. **Given** I have applied a due date filter, **When** I complete a todo, **Then** it is removed from or remains in the filtered view according to the completion filter settings

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user selects a date far in the future (e.g., years ahead)? System should accept and display it normally.
- What happens when a user tries to select a date far in the past? System should accept it and mark it as overdue.
- What happens when the system date changes (e.g., midnight passes) while the app is open? The system should update overdue/due today indicators when the page is refreshed or reloaded.
- What happens to due dates when todos are exported or if data is manually edited? Due dates are stored in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD), which is human-readable and survives storage and retrieval across different systems.
- What happens if a user's system is set to a different date format or timezone? The system should respect the user's local date format for display while storing dates in a consistent format.
- How are completed todos with due dates handled? They should retain their due dates for historical reference but be styled differently.
- What happens to existing todos when the due date feature is first deployed? The system automatically upgrades todos on first load by adding dueDate: null to any todo missing the field, ensuring seamless backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to optionally assign a due date to any todo (new or existing)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a date picker interface for selecting due dates
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide an edit icon (pencil/edit button) next to each todo that reveals inline editing controls including the date picker
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to remove the due date from a todo (due dates are optional)
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist due dates with todo data so they survive page refreshes
- **FR-005a**: System MUST automatically upgrade existing todos on first load after deployment by adding dueDate: null to any todo missing the field
- **FR-006**: System MUST display due dates alongside todos in a clear, readable format
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual indicators for overdue todos using both color styling and a warning icon to ensure accessibility
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual indicators for todos due today using both color styling and a calendar/today icon to ensure accessibility
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a toolbar above the todo list containing sort controls for due date ordering (ascending and descending)
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle todos without due dates appropriately in sorted views (appear at the end)
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide filter options in the toolbar above the todo list for viewing todos by due date criteria (overdue, due today, due this week, no due date)
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain filter and sort selections during the user session
- **FR-013**: System MUST display due dates for completed todos with appropriate styling to indicate completion
- **FR-014**: System MUST be keyboard accessible for all due date interactions (date picker, sort controls, filter controls)
- **FR-015**: System MUST announce due date changes and filter/sort updates to screen readers

### Key Entities

- **Todo**: Existing entity that will be extended with an optional due date field (ISO 8601 date string in YYYY-MM-DD format, or null if no due date)
- **Due Date**: Date value stored as ISO 8601 string (YYYY-MM-DD) to enable lexicographic sorting, reliable comparison, and cross-browser compatibility

### Assumptions

- Due dates are date-only (no specific time of day); a todo is considered due any time on its due date
- The system uses the user's local date and time to determine if tasks are overdue or due today
- Date format for display will follow common conventions (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY) based on user locale or a sensible default
- The date picker will be a native HTML date input or a simple, accessible custom picker
- Sorting and filtering by due date can coexist with existing completion status filters
- Due dates are not required; users can continue to use the app without setting due dates on any todos

## Success Criteria

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add a due date to a new todo in under 10 seconds
- **SC-002**: Users can edit an existing todo to add or change a due date in under 10 seconds
- **SC-003**: Visual indicators for overdue and due today todos are immediately recognizable through both color and iconography, ensuring accessibility for colorblind and visually impaired users
- **SC-004**: Sorting todos by due date arranges them correctly 100% of the time, with undated todos consistently positioned
- **SC-005**: Applying a due date filter shows only the relevant todos with no incorrect inclusions or omissions
- **SC-006**: All due date functionality (date picker, sort, filter) is fully keyboard accessible without requiring a mouse
- **SC-007**: Screen reader users can successfully set due dates, understand visual indicators, and use sort/filter controls
- **SC-008**: Due dates persist correctly across browser sessions and page refreshes
