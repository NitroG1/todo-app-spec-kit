# Specification Quality Checklist: Priority Levels for Todos

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

✅ **All validation items passed**

**Validation Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification focuses entirely on what users need (priority selection, visual indicators, filtering) and why they need it (task organization, quick identification). No mention of localStorage, JavaScript, DOM manipulation, or other implementation details.

2. **Requirement Completeness**:
   - All 15 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-001 can be verified by checking only 3 priority levels exist)
   - Success criteria are measurable (e.g., SC-001 specifies "under 5 seconds", SC-002 specifies "within 1 second")
   - Success criteria avoid implementation (e.g., SC-006 says "persists across browser sessions" not "saves to localStorage")
   - 4 user stories with complete Given/When/Then scenarios
   - 5 edge cases identified
   - Scope bounded to 3 specific priority levels with defined colors

3. **Feature Readiness**:
   - Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios (FR-002/FR-003 → Story 1, FR-006-010 → Story 2, etc.)
   - User scenarios prioritized (P1-P3) with independent test criteria
   - All success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable

**Assumptions Made**:
- Default priority is Medium (industry standard for 3-tier systems)
- Color scheme: Red=High, Orange/Yellow=Medium, Green/Blue=Low (standard urgency colors)
- Existing todos without priority get Medium as default (least disruptive migration)
- Filter state persists during user interactions but not across sessions (common UI pattern)

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (no clarifications needed)
