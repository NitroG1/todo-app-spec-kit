## Usage Notes

This checklist is designed to be used BEFORE implementation begins. Each item tests the **quality of the requirements writing**, not the implementation itself.

**How to use**:
1. Review each item against the spec, plan, data model, and research documents
2. Mark items as complete only when the requirement is documented clearly and completely
3. For incomplete items, update the requirements documents (spec.md, plan.md, etc.) to address gaps
4. For conflicts/ambiguities, resolve them by updating requirements before coding begins
5. Aim for 100% completion before starting implementation to avoid rework

**Not for**:
- Testing implementation correctness
- Verifying code quality
- QA/testing procedures

**For**:
- Validating requirement completeness
- Ensuring clarity and measurability
- Finding gaps before coding
- Preventing rework from ambiguous requirements
