# Feature Specification: Priority Levels for Todos

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-priority-levels`
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add priority levels (High, Medium, Low) to todos with visual indicators. Users should be able to set priority when creating/editing todos, filter by priority, and see priority in the todo list. Priority should be visually distinguished with colors and labels."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Setting Priority on New Todos (Priority: P1)

When creating a new todo item, users need to indicate its urgency or importance to help organize their workload. Users can select from three priority levels (High, Medium, Low) when creating a new todo.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the feature - without the ability to set priority, no other priority-related functionality can work. This delivers immediate value by allowing users to categorize tasks by importance.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating new todo items with each priority level and verifying they are saved with the correct priority value. Delivers value by enabling basic priority categorization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is creating a new todo, **When** they select "High" priority and save the todo, **Then** the todo is created with High priority
2. **Given** the user is creating a new todo, **When** they do not select a priority, **Then** the todo is created with Medium priority as the default
3. **Given** the user is creating a new todo, **When** they select "Low" priority and save the todo, **Then** the todo is created with Low priority

---

### User Story 2 - Visual Priority Indicators (Priority: P1)

Users need to quickly scan their todo list and identify which tasks are most urgent without reading every item in detail. Each todo displays a visual indicator (color and label) showing its priority level.

**Why this priority**: Visual indicators are essential for the feature to be useful - they allow users to quickly identify important tasks at a glance. Without this, setting priorities provides no practical benefit.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating todos with different priorities and verifying each displays the correct color and label. Delivers value through improved task visibility and quick prioritization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a todo has High priority, **When** the user views the todo list, **Then** the todo displays with a red color indicator and "High" label
2. **Given** a todo has Medium priority, **When** the user views the todo list, **Then** the todo displays with an orange/yellow color indicator and "Medium" label
3. **Given** a todo has Low priority, **When** the user views the todo list, **Then** the todo displays with a green/blue color indicator and "Low" label
4. **Given** multiple todos with different priorities, **When** the user views the todo list, **Then** each todo shows its distinct priority color and label

---

### User Story 3 - Editing Todo Priority (Priority: P2)

As work evolves, the urgency of tasks changes. Users need to update the priority of existing todos to reflect changing circumstances without recreating the todo.

**Why this priority**: While important for maintaining an up-to-date task list, users can initially work around this by deleting and recreating todos. This is less critical than initial creation and display.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by editing existing todos and changing their priority values, then verifying the changes persist. Delivers value through improved task management flexibility.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an existing todo with Medium priority, **When** the user edits it and changes priority to High, **Then** the todo updates to show High priority with appropriate visual indicators
2. **Given** an existing todo with any priority, **When** the user edits it and changes to a different priority, **Then** the change persists after saving
3. **Given** an existing todo being edited, **When** the user views priority options, **Then** the current priority is pre-selected

---

### User Story 4 - Filter Todos by Priority (Priority: P3)

When users have many todos, they want to focus on specific priority levels to avoid distraction and manage their workflow effectively. Users can filter the todo list to show only items of a selected priority level.

**Why this priority**: This is a nice-to-have enhancement that improves usability for users with many tasks. The core value (setting and viewing priorities) works without filtering. Users can manually scan for priority colors.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating todos with mixed priorities, applying each filter option, and verifying only matching todos are displayed. Delivers value through improved focus and workflow management.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** todos exist with mixed priorities, **When** the user selects "High priority" filter, **Then** only High priority todos are displayed
2. **Given** todos exist with mixed priorities, **When** the user selects "Medium priority" filter, **Then** only Medium priority todos are displayed
3. **Given** todos exist with mixed priorities, **When** the user selects "Low priority" filter, **Then** only Low priority todos are displayed
4. **Given** a filter is active, **When** the user selects "All priorities" or clears the filter, **Then** all todos are displayed regardless of priority
5. **Given** a filter is active, **When** no todos match the selected priority, **Then** the list shows an empty state with appropriate message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user creates a todo without selecting any priority (default to Medium)?
- How does the system handle todos created before the priority feature was added (assign Medium priority as default)?
- What happens when filtering shows zero results (display "No todos with this priority" message)?
- How are priorities displayed on completed/archived todos (same visual indicators, potentially muted)?
- What happens if the user rapidly toggles between priority filters (only the most recent filter applies)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support exactly three priority levels: High, Medium, and Low
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select a priority level when creating a new todo
- **FR-003**: System MUST default to Medium priority when no priority is explicitly selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to change the priority of existing todos through the edit function
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist priority information with each todo item
- **FR-006**: System MUST display a distinct color indicator for each priority level in the todo list
- **FR-007**: System MUST display a text label showing the priority level alongside the color indicator
- **FR-008**: System MUST use red coloring for High priority items
- **FR-009**: System MUST use orange or yellow coloring for Medium priority items
- **FR-010**: System MUST use green or blue coloring for Low priority items
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a filter control to show todos of a specific priority level
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to view all todos regardless of priority (clear/disable filter)
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain filter state while users interact with todos (create, edit, complete)
- **FR-014**: System MUST assign Medium priority to any existing todos that lack priority information
- **FR-015**: System MUST preserve priority information when a todo is marked as complete or incomplete

### Key Entities

- **Todo Item**: Represents a task with attributes including title, description, due date, completion status, and priority level (High/Medium/Low)
- **Priority Level**: An enumerated value (High, Medium, Low) associated with each todo, used for visual display and filtering
- **Filter State**: The currently active priority filter selection (High, Medium, Low, or All), affecting which todos are visible

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can select and assign a priority to a new todo in under 5 seconds
- **SC-002**: Users can identify the priority of any todo in the list within 1 second by visual indicators alone
- **SC-003**: 100% of todos display the correct priority color and label corresponding to their assigned priority
- **SC-004**: Users can change the priority of an existing todo and see the update reflected immediately
- **SC-005**: Users can filter a list of 50+ todos to a single priority level and see results displayed within 1 second
- **SC-006**: Priority information persists across browser sessions (todos retain their priority after page reload)
- **SC-007**: All existing todos without priority data are automatically assigned Medium priority without user intervention
