# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo List Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✅

- **No implementation details**: Specification avoids technical details. The only technology mentioned is "browser's built-in local storage" in the Assumptions section, which is appropriate context, not an implementation requirement.
- **User value focused**: All user stories and requirements describe what users can do and why it matters.
- **Non-technical language**: Written in plain language accessible to business stakeholders.
- **Mandatory sections**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✅

- **No clarification markers**: The specification contains zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. All requirements are fully specified with reasonable defaults.
- **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-015) describes specific, verifiable behavior.
- **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 success criteria include specific metrics (time, percentages, counts).
- **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes, not technical implementations.
- **Acceptance scenarios**: All 5 user stories have detailed Given/When/Then scenarios.
- **Edge cases**: 7 edge cases identified covering boundary conditions and error scenarios.
- **Clear scope**: Features are bounded to task management with local storage; explicitly excludes multi-user features.
- **Assumptions documented**: 7 assumptions clearly stated covering storage, retention, users, ordering, limits, browsers, and accessibility.

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✅

- **Requirements with criteria**: All 15 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in the user stories.
- **Coverage of primary flows**: 5 user stories cover the complete user journey from creation to persistence.
- **Measurable outcomes**: 10 success criteria provide clear quality gates for implementation.
- **No implementation leakage**: Specification remains implementation-agnostic throughout.

## Overall Assessment

**STATUS**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, clear, and ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (optional) or `/speckit.plan` (next recommended step).

### Strengths

1. Comprehensive user story breakdown with clear priorities (P1-P4)
2. Each user story is independently testable and delivers standalone value
3. Detailed acceptance scenarios cover both happy paths and edge cases
4. Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
5. No ambiguities requiring clarification
6. Accessibility requirements integrated throughout (per constitution)

### Notes

- User Story 5 (Persistent Storage) is correctly prioritized as P1 despite appearing last, as it's essential for application utility
- Assumptions section provides reasonable defaults for all unspecified details
- Edge cases anticipate common failure scenarios (storage limits, empty states, special characters)
- The specification aligns with the project constitution's principles of simplicity and accessibility
