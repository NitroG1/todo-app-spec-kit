# Quickstart Guide: Todo List Application

**Feature**: Todo List Application
**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Purpose**: Setup, development, and testing guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up, developing, and testing the todo list application. It serves as both a developer guide and a manual test script.

---

## Prerequisites

### Required
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, or any code editor)
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Optional
- Live Server extension (VS Code) for auto-reload during development
- Browser DevTools knowledge for debugging

---

## Project Setup

### Step 1: Create Project File

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd todo-app
   ```

2. Create the main HTML file:
   ```bash
   # Windows (PowerShell)
   New-Item -Path "index.html" -ItemType File

   # macOS/Linux
   touch index.html
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your text editor

---

### Step 2: Basic HTML Structure

Start with this basic HTML template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Todo List Application</title>
  <style>
    /* CSS will go here */
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>Todo List</h1>
    <!-- HTML structure will go here -->
  </main>

  <script>
    // JavaScript will go here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## Development Workflow

### Option 1: Direct File Opening

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser:
   - **Windows**: Double-click the file, or drag to browser
   - **macOS**: Open with browser from Finder
   - **Linux**: Right-click ‚Üí Open With ‚Üí Browser

2. After making changes, refresh the browser (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`)

### Option 2: Live Server (Recommended)

1. Install Live Server in VS Code:
   - Extensions panel ‚Üí Search "Live Server" ‚Üí Install

2. Right-click `index.html` ‚Üí "Open with Live Server"

3. Browser opens automatically; auto-refreshes on file save

---

## Debugging Tips

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Tasks not persisting
**Solution**: Check browser console for localStorage errors. Verify browser allows localStorage (not in private mode).

#### Issue: Tasks not rendering
**Solution**: Check console for JavaScript errors. Verify `renderTasks()` is called after `loadTasks()`.

#### Issue: Filter buttons not working
**Solution**: Verify event listeners are attached. Check `setFilter()` calls `renderTasks()`.

#### Issue: Delete button not working
**Solution**: Ensure delete button event listeners are attached when rendering tasks. Check `taskId` is correctly passed.

### Browser DevTools

**Open DevTools**:
- Windows/Linux: `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`
- macOS: `Cmd+Option+I`

**Useful Panels**:
- **Console**: See errors and log messages
- **Elements**: Inspect HTML/CSS
- **Application** ‚Üí **Storage** ‚Üí **Local Storage**: View stored data
- **Network**: Check if any unexpected requests (should be none)

**Debugging localStorage**:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log(localStorage.getItem('todoAppTasks'));
console.log(localStorage.getItem('todoAppFilter'));

// Clear all data (reset)
localStorage.clear();
```

## Performance Validation

### Load Time Test

1. Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
2. Hard refresh page (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
3. Check total load time in Network panel
4. **Expected**: < 1 second

### Operation Speed Test

1. Add 100+ tasks
2. Test these operations:
   - Add task: **Expected** < 100ms
   - Delete task: **Expected** < 100ms
   - Toggle complete: **Expected** < 100ms
   - Change filter: **Expected** < 50ms

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] No perceptible lag on any operation
- [ ] Smooth interaction with 100+ tasks
