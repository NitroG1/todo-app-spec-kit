# Feature Specification: Todo List Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-todo`
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a todo list app where users can: Add new tasks to their list, Mark tasks as complete with a checkbox, Delete tasks they no longer need, Filter to see all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks, Save tasks so they don't disappear when the browser closes"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and View Tasks (Priority: P1)

A user opens the todo list application and wants to add their first task. They type a task description and add it to their list. The task immediately appears in their todo list, ready to be managed.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational functionality—without the ability to create and view tasks, the application has no purpose. It's the minimum viable product that delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the app, adding a task with text "Buy groceries", and verifying it appears in the list. Delivers immediate value as a basic note-taking tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is open with an empty task list, **When** the user types "Buy groceries" and submits the task, **Then** the task appears in the list with an unchecked checkbox
2. **Given** the application already has 2 tasks, **When** the user adds a new task "Call dentist", **Then** the new task appears in the list and the existing tasks remain unchanged
3. **Given** the user has typed task text, **When** the user submits the task, **Then** the input field clears and is ready for the next task
4. **Given** the input field is empty, **When** the user attempts to submit, **Then** no empty task is created

### User Story 2 - Mark Tasks Complete (Priority: P2)

A user has several tasks in their list and wants to track their progress. They click the checkbox next to a completed task to mark it as done. The task's appearance changes to indicate completion, giving them a sense of accomplishment.

**Why this priority**: This enables users to track progress and distinguish between what's done and what remains. It's the core differentiator between a task list and a simple note list.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by pre-populating the list with tasks, clicking a checkbox, and verifying the task's visual state changes (e.g., strikethrough text). Delivers value by enabling progress tracking.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task "Buy groceries" exists with an unchecked checkbox, **When** the user clicks the checkbox, **Then** the task is marked as complete with visual indication (strikethrough or similar)
2. **Given** a task is marked as complete, **When** the user clicks the checkbox again, **Then** the task returns to active state with normal appearance
3. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** the user marks one as complete, **Then** only that task's state changes and other tasks remain unchanged

---

### User Story 3 - Delete Tasks (Priority: P3)

A user has completed a task or added something by mistake and wants to remove it from their list. They click a delete button next to the task, and it is immediately removed from their view, keeping their list clean and relevant.

**Why this priority**: This enables list management and cleanup. While not critical for basic functionality, it prevents list clutter and improves long-term usability.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by pre-populating tasks, clicking delete on one task, and verifying it's removed while others remain. Delivers value by enabling list cleanup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a task "Buy groceries" exists in the list, **When** the user clicks the delete button for that task, **Then** the task is immediately removed from the list
2. **Given** multiple tasks exist, **When** the user deletes one task, **Then** only that specific task is removed and other tasks remain in their original order
3. **Given** a task is deleted, **When** the user refreshes the page, **Then** the deleted task does not reappear

---

### User Story 4 - Filter Tasks by Status (Priority: P4)

A user has accumulated many tasks in various states and wants to focus on specific categories. They can filter their view to see all tasks, only active tasks they still need to complete, or only completed tasks to review what they've accomplished.

**Why this priority**: This improves usability when the list grows, but the app is functional without it. It's a convenience feature that enhances the experience for power users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by creating a mix of active and completed tasks, clicking filter buttons, and verifying only the appropriate tasks display. Delivers value by reducing visual clutter.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the list contains 3 active tasks and 2 completed tasks with "All" filter selected, **When** the user views the list, **Then** all 5 tasks are visible
2. **Given** the "All" filter is active, **When** the user clicks the "Active" filter, **Then** only the 3 uncompleted tasks are displayed
3. **Given** the "Active" filter is selected, **When** the user clicks the "Completed" filter, **Then** only the 2 completed tasks are displayed
4. **Given** any filter is active, **When** the user adds a new task, **Then** the filter remains active and the new task appears if it matches the current filter criteria
5. **Given** the "Active" filter is selected, **When** the user marks a task as complete, **Then** the task disappears from view (as it no longer matches the active filter)

---

### User Story 5 - Persistent Storage (Priority: P1)

A user adds several tasks and closes their browser. When they return later and open the application again, all their tasks are still there exactly as they left them—with the same completion states and in the same order.

**Why this priority**: Without persistence, the application loses all value the moment the user closes it. This is a critical P1 feature alongside task creation because a task list that doesn't remember is essentially useless.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by adding tasks, closing the browser tab completely, reopening the application, and verifying all tasks are restored. Delivers essential value by making the app actually useful beyond a single session.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user has added 3 tasks, **When** the user closes the browser and reopens the application, **Then** all 3 tasks are displayed exactly as they were
2. **Given** the user has marked 2 tasks as complete, **When** the user closes and reopens the application, **Then** the 2 tasks are still marked as complete
3. **Given** the user has deleted a task, **When** the user closes and reopens the application, **Then** the deleted task does not reappear
4. **Given** the user has set a specific filter view, **When** the user closes and reopens the application, **Then** the filter preference is remembered

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user tries to add a task with only whitespace characters?
- What happens when the user tries to add an extremely long task description (1000+ characters)?
- What happens if storage quota is exceeded (many thousands of tasks)?
- What happens when the user has no tasks and views the "Active" or "Completed" filter?
- What happens when the user deletes all tasks?
- What happens if the user's browser has local storage disabled or restricted?
- What happens when a task description contains special characters or emojis?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add new tasks by entering text and submitting
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all tasks in a list format with clear visual separation between items
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a checkbox next to each task to toggle completion status
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide a visual indicator (such as strikethrough text) to distinguish completed tasks from active tasks
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a delete control for each task that removes it from the list
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent creation of empty tasks (tasks with no text or only whitespace)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide three filter options: "All", "Active", and "Completed"
- **FR-008**: System MUST display only tasks matching the currently selected filter
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist all task data so it survives browser closure and page refresh
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist task text, completion status, and order
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist the user's current filter selection
- **FR-012**: System MUST clear the task input field after successfully adding a task
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain task order (newly added tasks should appear in a consistent position, such as at the bottom of the list)
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle storage limitations gracefully, informing the user if storage quota is exceeded
- **FR-015**: System MUST load persisted tasks immediately when the application opens

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a single todo item. Core attributes include unique identifier, task description text, completion status (complete/incomplete), and creation timestamp for ordering.

- **Filter State**: Represents the current view filter. Possible values are "All", "Active", or "Completed". Determines which tasks are visible to the user.

### Assumptions

- **Storage Mechanism**: Will use browser's built-in local storage capability for persistence (standard in modern browsers)
- **Data Retention**: Tasks persist indefinitely until explicitly deleted by the user
- **Single User**: Application is designed for single-user use per browser (no authentication or multi-user support)
- **Task Order**: New tasks are added to the bottom of the list; order is maintained unless explicitly reordered by the user in a future enhancement
- **Character Limit**: Task descriptions will support up to 1000 characters (reasonable for typical task descriptions)
- **Browser Support**: Application will support modern browsers that have local storage capability (IE11+, all current Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge versions)
- **Accessibility**: Application will follow WCAG AA standards for accessibility (per constitution Principle IV)
