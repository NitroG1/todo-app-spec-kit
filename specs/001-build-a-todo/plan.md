# Implementation Plan: Todo List Application

**Branch**: `001-build-a-todo` | **Date**: 2025-10-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-a-todo/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a browser-based todo list application that allows users to add, complete, delete, and filter tasks with persistent storage. The application will use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with localStorage for data persistence, organized with clear, well-commented functions for each feature. Focus on simplicity, accessibility, and beginner-friendly code per project constitution.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript ES6+ (vanilla, no frameworks)
**Primary Dependencies**: None (zero external dependencies)
**Storage**: Browser localStorage API (native Web Storage API)
**Testing**: Manual testing initially; future consideration for Jest or similar for unit tests
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome 4+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Edge 12+, IE 8+ for localStorage support)
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (client-side only)
**Performance Goals**:
  - Initial page load < 1 second
  - Task operations (add/delete/toggle) < 100ms response time
  - Filter changes instant (< 50ms)
  - Support 1000+ tasks without degradation
**Constraints**:
  - Client-side only (no server/backend)
  - localStorage limit typically 5-10MB (sufficient for thousands of tasks)
  - Must work offline after initial load
  - Must meet WCAG AA accessibility standards
**Scale/Scope**:
  - Single-user per browser
  - Estimated 50-200 lines of JavaScript
  - 50-100 lines of CSS
  - Single HTML file
  - Support up to 1000 tasks per user

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Code Simplicity & Beginner-Friendliness
✅ **PASS** - Vanilla JavaScript with no frameworks or complex patterns. All code will use straightforward functions with clear names. No advanced patterns required.

**Compliance Plan**:
- Use simple, descriptive function names (e.g., `addTask()`, `deleteTask()`, `toggleTaskComplete()`)
- Each function handles one specific operation
- Avoid complex closures, decorators, or advanced patterns
- Break logic into small, single-purpose functions

### Principle II: Comprehensive Documentation via Comments
✅ **PASS** - All functions will have detailed comment blocks explaining purpose, parameters, and return values.

**Compliance Plan**:
- Every function gets a comment block with description, parameters, return value
- Complex logic (like localStorage operations) gets inline step-by-step comments
- Variable declarations include purpose comments where not obvious
- Comments written in beginner-friendly language

### Principle III: Modern JavaScript with Controlled Complexity
✅ **PASS** - Using approved ES6+ features only: `const`/`let`, template literals, arrow functions for simple callbacks, array methods (`.map()`, `.filter()`, `.forEach()`).

**Approved Features in Use**:
- `const` and `let` for variable declarations
- Template literals for dynamic HTML generation
- Arrow functions for event listeners and simple callbacks
- Array methods: `.filter()` for filtering tasks, `.map()` for rendering, `.forEach()` for iteration

**Restricted Features Avoided**:
- No generators, proxies, symbols
- No complex destructuring
- No `.reduce()` (will use simple loops if aggregation needed)

### Principle IV: Universal Accessibility
✅ **PASS** - Full WCAG AA compliance planned with semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and proper contrast.

**Compliance Plan**:
- Semantic HTML: `<main>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<button>`, `<input>`, `<label>`
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible (tab navigation, enter/space for actions)
- Proper labels for all form inputs
- ARIA labels for icon-only buttons (delete button)
- ARIA live region for announcing task additions/removals to screen readers
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA (checked during design phase)
- Visual completion indicator (strikethrough) + checkbox state for redundancy

### Principle V: Minimal & Clean Design
✅ **PASS** - Simple, clean UI with minimal CSS. Zero external dependencies. Flat code structure.

**Compliance Plan**:
- Zero external dependencies (no libraries, frameworks, or icon fonts)
- Single HTML file structure
- Organized CSS with clear sections (reset, layout, components, states)
- No unused styles
- Generous whitespace in UI
- Consistent design patterns (button styles, spacing, colors)
- Flat JavaScript structure (no deep nesting or complex hierarchies)

### Gate Status: ✅ ALL GATES PASS

No constitutional violations. No complexity justification required. Ready to proceed to Phase 0.

```

**Structure Decision**: Single-file web application

This is a simple, client-side-only web application. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be contained in a single `index.html` file for maximum simplicity and ease of deployment. This structure is ideal for:

- **Beginner accessibility**: Everything in one place, easy to understand the complete application
- **Zero build process**: Open the HTML file directly in a browser
- **Easy deployment**: Single file can be hosted anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, any static host)
- **Minimal complexity**: No separate source directories, bundlers, or module systems needed

For a production application or larger project, code would typically be split into separate `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files, but the single-file approach aligns with our constitution's principles of simplicity and beginner-friendliness.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

No constitutional violations. This section is not applicable.
